All the preparations tasted good.........
Along with the regular BBQN specalities, the western starters and main course they are serving are just too good...
BBQ nation is one of the best and famous place for buffet.
Barbeque Nation is heaven for foodies and they will surely diminish hunger pangs of anyone hungry provided you can endure the long queues if you go there unplanned.

Coming to the desserts, the chocolate carrot cake was way too eggy.
Coming to the main course, it was to be very honest, disappointing.
Excellent service and exception food
However, the sea food dish in coconut gravy was delicious.
I considered the Gulab Jamuns to be the hero of the Dessert Section until I proceeded towards the Kulfi Junction.
In the main course I opted for Indian breads (Naan) and Dal Makhani (Tasty), Veg Noodles (Good), Fried Rice & Chicken Curry (Bland & Less Spicy), Chilly Fish (Good).
It also had a live pasta counter....the pasta was just awesome....
Mango kuli with rabari is yum
Starters include Mediterranean Prawn (Juicy & Delicious), Chicken Barbeque (Great), Chicken Wings (So-So), Mutton Kebab (Great), Cilantro flavoured Fish Barbeque (Amazing).
Starting with the Crispy Baby Corns which is the most delicious starter that i love the most of this restaurant.
Tasted Chocolate Cake (Good), Strawberry Cheesecake (Good), Moong Dal Halwa (Delicious), Custard (Good), Hot Mini Gulab Jamuna (Out of this World).
Tasted the Tomato Basil Soup which tasted okay.
The blueberry cheesecake was slightly more bitter than it should be.
The firni is brilliant and so are the gulab jamuns.
